    <h1>Make an Image Responsive</h1>

    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Making images responsive with CSS is actually very simple. You just need to add these properties to an image:</p>

    img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    }

    <p> The max-width of 100% will make sure the image is never wider than the container it is in, and the height of
        auto will make the image keep its original aspect ratio.</p>


    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <p>Add the style rules to the responsive-img class to make it responsive. It should never be wider than its
        container (in this case, it's the preview window) and it should keep its original aspect ratio. After you have
        added your code, resize the preview to see how your images behave.</p>


    <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
    <style>
        .responsive-img {
            max-width: 100%;
            height: auto;

        }

        img {
            width: 600px;
        }
    </style>
