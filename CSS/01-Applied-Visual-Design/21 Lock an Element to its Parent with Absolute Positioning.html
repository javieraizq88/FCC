    <h1>Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning</h1>
    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p> The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to its
        parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document,
        so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust
        the position. One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned
        ancestor. If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position:
        relative;), the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.</p>


    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <p>Lock the #searchbar element to the top-right of its section parent by declaring its position as absolute. Give it
        top and right offsets of 50 pixels each.</p>

    <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
    <style>
        #searchbar {
            position: absolute;
            top: 50px;
            right: 50px;
        }

        section {
            position: relative;
        }
    </style>

    <body>
        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <section>
            <form id="searchbar">
                <label for="search">Search:</label>
                <input type="search" id="search" name="search">
                <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Go!">
            </form>
        </section>
