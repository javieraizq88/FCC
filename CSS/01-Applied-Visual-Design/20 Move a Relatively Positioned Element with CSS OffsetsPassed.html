    <h1>Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS OffsetsPassed</h1>

    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where
        it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which
        moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last
        challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the
        right.</p>


    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <p> Use CSS offsets to move the h2 15 pixels to the right and 10 pixels up.</p>


    <h2>SOLUTION</h2>

    <head>
        <style>
            h2 {
                position: relative;
                left: 15px;
                bottom: 10px;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
        <h2>Move me!</h2>
        <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
