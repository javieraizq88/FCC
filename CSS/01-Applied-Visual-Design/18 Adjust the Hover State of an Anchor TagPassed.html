    <h1>Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor TagPassed</h1>
    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to
        selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element. For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be
        changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the color of the
        anchor tag to red during its hover state: </p>

    a:hover {
    color: red;
    }

    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <p> The code editor has a CSS rule to style all a tags black. Add a rule so that when the user hovers over the a
        tag, the color is blue.</p>

        
    <h2>SOLUTION</h2>

    <style>
        a {
            color: #000;
        }

        a:hover {
            color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1);
        }
    </style>
