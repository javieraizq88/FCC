    <h1>Learn about Tertiary ColorsPassed</h1>
    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p> Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light.
        This is known as the RGB additive color model in modern color theory. Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are
        called primary colors. Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B) and
        yellow (R + G). You saw these colors in the Complementary Colors challenge. These secondary colors happen to be
        the complement to the primary color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the
        color wheel. For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green. </p>

    <p> Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For
        example, within the RGB color model, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange (tertiary). This adds six
        more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.</p>

    <p> There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design. One
        example that can use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a
        base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide
        strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.</p>

    <p> Here are three colors created using the split-complement scheme:</p>

    <p> Color Hex Code</p>
    <p> orange #FF7F00</p>
    <p>cyan #00FFFF</p>
    <p>raspberry #FF007F</p>

    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

    <p>Change the background-color property of the orange, cyan, and raspberry classes to their respective colors. Make
        sure to use the hex codes and not the color names.</p>

    <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
    <style>
        body {
            background-color: #FFFFFF;
        }

        .orange {
            background-color: #FF7F00;
        }

        .cyan {
            background-color: #00FFFF;
        }

        .raspberry {
            background-color: #FF007F;
        }
    </style>

    <div class="orange"></div>
    <div class="cyan"></div>
    <div class="raspberry"></div>
