  <hi>Animate Elements Continually Using an Infinite Animation Count</hi>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p> The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. Another
    animation property is the animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control how many times you would like to
    loop through the animation. Here's an example:</p>
  <p> animation-iteration-count: 3;</p>
  <p>In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run
    continuously by setting that value to infinite.</p>


  <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
  <p> To keep the ball bouncing on the right on a continuous loop, change the animation-iteration-count property to
    infinite.</p>


  <h2>SOLUTION</h2>
  <style>
    #ball {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      margin: 50px auto;
      position: relative;
      border-radius: 50%;
      background: linear-gradient(35deg,
          #ccffff,
          #ffcccc);
      animation-name: bounce;
      animation-duration: 1s;
      animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    }

    @keyframes bounce {
      0% {
        top: 0px;
      }

      50% {
        top: 249px;
        width: 130px;
        height: 70px;
      }

      100% {
        top: 0px;
      }
    }
  </style>
  <div id="ball"></div>
