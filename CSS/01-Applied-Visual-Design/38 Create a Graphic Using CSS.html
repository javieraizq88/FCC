  <hi>Create a Graphic Using CSS</hi>
  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>By manipulating different selectors and properties, you can make interesting shapes. One of the easier ones to try
    is a crescent moon shape. For this challenge you need to work with the box-shadow property that sets the shadow of
    an element, along with the border-radius property that controls the roundness of the element's corners.</p>
  <p>You will create a round, transparent object with a crisp shadow that is slightly offset to the side - the shadow is
    actually going to be the moon shape you see.</p>
  <p>In order to create a round object, the border-radius property should be set to a value of 50%.</p>
  <p>You may recall from an earlier challenge that the box-shadow property takes values for offset-x, offset-y,
    blur-radius, spread-radius and a color value in that order. The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.
  </p>


  <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
  <p>Manipulate the square element in the editor to create the moon shape. First, change the background-color to
    transparent, then set the border-radius property to 50% to make the circular shape. Finally, change the box-shadow
    property to set the offset-x to 25px, the offset-y to 10px, blur-radius to 0, spread-radius to 0, and color to blue.
  </p>
