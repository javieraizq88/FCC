{ /*   <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

    i--;
    
    is the equivalent of
    
    i = i - 1;
    
    Note
    The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.
*/}

    {/*
    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
Change the code to use the -- operator on myVar.
    */}

    var myVar = 11;

    // Only change code below this line
    myVar--;
